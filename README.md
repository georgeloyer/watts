 Watts mobile robot project
 Watts is an in-the-world laboratory for exploring subsumption architecture fused with machine learning to produce
 emergent behaviors that are interesting to interact with for the humans in their world.

 A subsumption architecture (Rodney Brooks) is layered behaviors that are able to stand on their own and are
 combined in a priority scheme that allows only one to control the behaviors of Watts at a time.  Since Watts
 will evolve into presenting behaviors in multiple dimensions (movement, sound interaction, visual interaction)
 that will provide a rich playground for exploration of how a subsumption architecture can create interesting
 emergent behaviors.
