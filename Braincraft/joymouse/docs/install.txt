Installing joymouse

Install the pyautogui library and its python dependencies
sudo pip3 install pyautogui

Install the python3-xlib library 
sudo apt-get install python3-xlib

Set the DISPLAY environment variable in the 'pi' user .bashrc
The :0 display is the default for the display that will be written to
DISPLAY=:0

Create links for three files: the joymouse daemon, its wrapper script and the service file
sudo ln joymouse /usr/local/bin/joymouse
sudo ln run-joymouse.sh /usr/local/bin/run-joymouse.sh
sudo ln joymouse.service /usr/local/lib/systemd/system/joymouse.service
sudo ln joymouse.service /etc/systemd/system/joymouse.service

The systemd.service entries are typical for a forking daemon
There is one exception and that is the User is run as pi instead of root
User=pi

This daemon must be run as pi because the default xhost permissions on the 
Raspberry Pi allow the pi user to control the display.  Even though you 
can add other users to those allowed to control the display, like this:

> xhost +si:localuser:root

The change in permissions for xhost is lost with the session and I was unable
to find a way to give the permission after a reboot, so systemd would always
fail to start up the daemon because it did not have permission to use the X
windows system.

I've noticed that on reboot, the joymouse daemon does not at first seem to have
come up successfully, but after about a minute, the process appears in the
ps -ef and the status reports the daemon as 'activating' and with a subprocess
id.  And it works on the screen.
